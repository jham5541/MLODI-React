#### Option 1: Expo (Recommended for React Native)
```bash
# Build for all platforms
eas build --platform all

# Submit to app stores
eas submit
```

#### Option 2: Traditional Build
```bash
# iOS
cd ios && pod install
npx react-native run-ios --configuration Release

# Android
cd android && ./gradlew assembleRelease
```

## 🧪 Testing the Changes

### Automated Testing:
```bash
# Run the test script (requires Node.js)
