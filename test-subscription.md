# Subscription Test Checklist

## âœ… Fixed Issues:
1. **Database Permissions**: RLS policies now allow authenticated users to:
   - Create their own artist subscriptions
   - View their own artist subscriptions
   - Update their own artist subscriptions
   - Create and view their own transactions

2. **Error Handling**: Added comprehensive error logging throughout the subscription flow

3. **Auth Handling**: Modal now properly uses authenticated user from AuthContext

4. **Refresh Mechanism**: Revenue Insights will refresh immediately after subscription

## ðŸ§ª Testing Steps:

1. **Navigate to Artist Profile**
   - Open the app
   - Go to any artist's profile page

2. **Test Subscription Flow**
   - Click the "Subscribe" button in the artist header
   - Select a payment method (Apple Pay, Credit Card, or Web3 Wallet)
   - Watch for the 2-second payment processing simulation
   - Should see "Subscription Successful!" alert

3. **Verify Immediate Update**
   - After successful subscription, the Revenue Insights should refresh
   - The "Subscriptions" count should increase by 1
   - No page refresh required

4. **Check Console Logs**
   Look for these log messages:
   - "SubscriptionService: Starting subscription process..."
   - "SubscriptionService: User authenticated: [user-id]"
   - "SubscriptionService: Processing payment..."
   - "SubscriptionService: Creating subscription record..."
   - "SubscriptionService: Recording transaction..."
   - "SubscriptionService: Subscription completed successfully!"

5. **Test Unsubscribe**
   - Click the subscribe button again (should show "You're subscribed!")
   - Click "Unsubscribe"
   - Confirm the action
   - Revenue Insights should update again

## ðŸš¨ If Issues Persist:

1. Check if user is logged in:
   - The error might be auth-related
   - Try logging out and back in

2. Verify tables exist:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM artist_subscriptions LIMIT 1;
   SELECT * FROM transactions LIMIT 1;
   ```

3. Check current policies:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM pg_policies 
   WHERE tablename IN ('artist_subscriptions', 'transactions');
   ```

## âœ¨ What's Working Now:
- Proper database permissions via RLS
- User authentication flow
- Payment simulation
- Database record creation
- Transaction logging
- Immediate UI updates
- Error handling with meaningful messages
